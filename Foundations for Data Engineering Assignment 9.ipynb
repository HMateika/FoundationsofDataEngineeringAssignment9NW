    "## When trying to figure out how to get to cover distances there are multiple approaches that can be taken. For instance to get to a distance of 3, it can be covered in 3 one steps, 1 one step and 1 two step, 1 3 step, and 1 two step and 1 one step. This makes for a total of 4 methods that it can take to cover a distance of 3. Using similar methods to cover a distance of 4, there are a total of 7 methods to get there when limited at most to 3 steps. The number of methods it can be used to cover a certain distance gets more outrageous as time goes on, to the point where it would be nearly impossible to cover by hand. \n",

For instance, when performing the function with the distance 10 there are 274 methods received. This is based off of adding the subset values 44, 81, and 149 (and even these are based off of solutions from previous steps). This dynamic programming solution basically allows for further build up over time."

    "## This dynamic programming has a Big O notation of O(n) meaning that the program will increase at a fairly linear rate. As the size of the distance increases the time it will take to complete this program will increase as well. It is important for every data engineer to utilize dynamic programming since it is capable of taking breaking down problems into subsets of solution. This, at times, will allow it to run at a faster rate. It is also important to find a dynamic programming solution that is optimal for Big O notation. There is a solution to this form that would have had a Big O notation of O(3^n) which is a far slower rate in comparison to the above problem implemented."
